      <p>Hello. I am a software developer in Bozeman, MT.</p>
      <p>
        I am also a husband, father, and family man. I am an avid outdoorsman who enjoys skiing,
        climbing, camping, mountaineering, and mountain biking.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, I attended Actualize Coding Bootcamp and learned full-stack development using Ruby
        on Rails and JavaScript. I had previously worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I plan to utilize this site as an outlet for written expression. I will post occasional
        blogs about whatever is on my mind and also regular, monthly learnings related to software
        development.
